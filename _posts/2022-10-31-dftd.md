title: "Book review: DevOps for the desperate"
---

I thought I'd start off my first blog post with a book review on [DevOps for the Desperate](https://nostarch.com/devops-desperate)

The book is aimed at giving software engineers a glimpse at the tooling surrounding modern devOps. It's not going to make you an expert, think more along the lines of generalist.https

The book covers topics including Linux Administration, VMs, Containerization, Ansible and server monitoring.

I enjoyed playing around with creating a docker container with Ubuntu and enhancing the security of it via ansible. This was a slight hack compared to his example usecases which rely on you using vagrant instead of a container.

Despite having used ansible at work for a number of years, I wasn't ware of the privilaged escalation that can be inserted into playbooks:

```
---
- name: Provision VM
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  remote_user: ubuntu
---
```

This was handy for a project I'm working on where I need to run sudo cmds on a daily basis on a remote server.

{% highlight docker %}

FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt update && apt install  openssh-server sudo -y
RUN useradd -rm -d /home/ubuntu -s /bin/bash -g root -G sudo -u 1000 test
RUN  echo 'test:test' | chpasswd

RUN service ssh start
{% endhighlight %}


There is a wealth of unix command info which I have added to my to do list to learn in greater detail. To name a few:

- strace
- awk
- sed

as well as info on unix logging e.g /var/log/dmesg

In summary I'd give this book 5\* for an inspiring read on how to automate and upskill your devOps activities.

Incidentally, whilst reading this book I came across the [windows terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). I highly recommend switching to this.
