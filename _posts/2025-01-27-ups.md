title: "UPS"
---

Ocassionally my apartment gets power outages due to lightning/breaker overloading. To protect my Nas & home server I've added in a UPS.

The UPS has USB connectivity to the nas providing data on the UPS state. The Nas can then communicate to other servers about the UPS state, advising them to shutdown if necessary.

The package used to manage UPS state is NUT https://networkupstools.org/

Should the UPS/Nas UPS service shutdown, my home server will subsequently shutdown to protect against power drop.

I actually have a scheduled power outage in February so it will be interesting to see if it works!

Other tips:

1. Battery needs to be replaced every 5-6 years
2. OEM batteries can be used to save costs
3. Testing is key
4. Frequent full run downs of the battery weaken it. It's better to promptly shutdown rather than full drain if possible
