title: "Selenium & Chat GPT API"
---

## Introduction
Selenium is a great way to pull data from sites that have javascript mixed in with the html - which is most of the web these days.

I experimented recently with pulling weather data from https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html, providing an automated daily feed to my phone such that I didn't have to use their web interface.

Using ChatGPT API is a great way to process data from online sources. For example, use cases an include translation, categorisation and summarisation to name a few.

## Key takeway
Creating daily/weekly/monthly reports by publicly available data & then using chatGPT as an engine to drive this process is a great tool.
